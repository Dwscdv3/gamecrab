# gamecrab - A Game Boy emulator in Rust

A minimalist hobby emulator with no accuracy in mind.

It's capable of running my own [gblinez](https://github.com/Dwscdv3/gblinez),
but still lacks a lot of features, such as:

- Window layer
- Audio
- Serial port
- Keybinding

## Install

Requires distro package SDL2 on Unix-like platforms.

## Keybinding

- Arrow keys: D-Pad
- A: Select
- S: Start
- Z: A
- X: B
